<h3>
From Simon</h3>
Simon has created the following scenarios.&nbsp; There is no time to integrate
them / reconcile the format, so I will just link to them for now.&nbsp;
We can discuss format later.

<h3>
Welcome Editor</h3>
Purpose: To test the Welcome Editor in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will start the
workbench after a fresh install, verify the visibility of the welcome editor,
and then test the format and links.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.&nbsp; This will simulate a fresh
install.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.&nbsp; Confirm that the default perspective (Resource)
and welcome editor both appear.</li>

<li>
Close the editor and exit the workbench.</li>

<li>
Restart the workbench and verify that the welcome editor does not appear.&nbsp;
The editor only appears automatically after a fresh install.</li>

<li>
Invoke Help > Welcome and verify that the welcome editor opens.</li>

<li>
The welcome editor contains a number of links for "Java Project", "Window
> Preferences", "Perspective > Reset", etc.&nbsp; Test each of these links
to ensure that the link invokes an appropriate action.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Window Actions</h3>
Purpose: To test the standard menu and toolbar actions in Eclipse.&nbsp;
We will create a project, open some editors, test the global actions, test
the persistance of workbench state between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.</li>
</ol>
Testing the File Menu:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > New > Project.&nbsp; A wizard will appear where you can select
a project type.&nbsp; Select each item in the left hand viewer to verify
the basic page operation.&nbsp; Then select Simple > Project and press
Next.&nbsp; Type "SimpleProject" as the name for the project and press
Finish.&nbsp; Verify that a new Resource perspective is created and that
SimpleProject appears in the Navigator view.</li>

<li>
Create a few folders and files (one.txt, two.txt, three.txt) within SimpleProject.&nbsp;
For more information on this process refer to Simon's work on the New Wizard.</li>

<li>
Open one.txt within a text editor.&nbsp; Verify that File > Close and Save
As are enabled.&nbsp; Verify that Save is disabled.</li>

<li>
Add the following text to the file..</li>

<p><br>File One
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Once you modify a file the File > Save action should become enabled and
a small asterix should appear in the editor tab.&nbsp; Invoke Save and
verify that the asterix disappears and that the File > Save action is disabled.</li>

<li>
Open two.txt.&nbsp; Add the following text to the file..</li>

<p><br>File Two
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Open three.txt and add the following text to the file..</li>

<p><br>File Three
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you close an editor which is dirty the workbench should ask if you want
to save it.&nbsp; With three.txt active invoke File > Close.&nbsp; Verify
that the Save dialog appears.&nbsp; Press Yes.&nbsp; Then reopen the file
to verify that the text was saved.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Close All.&nbsp; At this point there is 1 dirty editor.&nbsp;
Verify that the Save Resources dialog appears.&nbsp; Press Yes.&nbsp; The
dirty editors should be saved and all editors will close.</li>

<li>
Verify that File > Close, Close All, Save, Save As, and Save All are disabled.</li>
</ol>
Testing the Edit Menu:
<ol>
<li>
The edit actions should target the active view or editor.&nbsp; To test
this ..</li>

<ol>
<li>
Select a file in the navigator view.&nbsp; Invoke Edit > Delete and verify
that the Delete File dialog appears for the current selection in the navigator.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close the dialog without completing the delete.</li>

<li>
Select the file again and invoke Edit > Add Bookmark.&nbsp; Open the Bookmarks
view and verify that a bookmark exists for the file.&nbsp; Select the bookmark.&nbsp;
Invoke Edit > Delete and verify that the bookmark is deleted in the bookmarks
view.</li>

<li>
Open one.txt in a text editor.&nbsp; Select a piece of text and invoke
Edit > Cut.&nbsp; Verify that the selection in the text editor is cut.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Create a file named X.java.&nbsp; Open it in an editor and then verify
that the Java editor actions are contributed to the workbench menu and
toolbar.</li>

<li>
Open one.txt in an editor.&nbsp; Verify that the java editor actions are
no longer visible in the workbench.</li>

<li>
Activate the java editor and verify that its contributions appear once
again.</li>

<li>
Close the java editor and verify that the contributions disappear.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Window Layout</h3>
Purpose: To test window layout in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will open a perspective,
test the layout features, open a second perspective, switch between perspectives,
and then create some windows.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Create a project with 3 .txt files.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.</li>
</ol>
Testing a Single Perspective:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Drag the navigator over the left hand tool bar.&nbsp; Verify that a stack
icon appears.&nbsp; Drop the view on the tool bar. It should become a fast
view.</li>

<li>
Click on the navigator fast view button to show the view.&nbsp; Click on
another view to hide it.&nbsp; You can also hide the view by clicking on
the "hide" button or the fast view button.</li>

<li>
Close the Outline view.&nbsp; Then invoke Perspective > Show View > Outline
to show it again.&nbsp; Verify that it has the same position as before.</li>

<li>
Select a text file in the navigator and open it.&nbsp; Verify that the
navigator fast view is hidden and an editor appears in the editor area.</li>

<li>
Modify the contents of the editor and verify that File > Save becomes enabled.&nbsp;
Save the file and verify that File > Save is disabled.</li>

<li>
Modify the contents of the editor again and close the editor.&nbsp; Verify
that the Save dialog appears and you can answer, yes, no, and cancel.</li>

<li>
Open 3 text files within 3 editors.&nbsp; The editors appear in a single
folder.</li>

<li>
Drag one editor out of the folder.&nbsp; Verify that the relative placement
icons are shown when you are to the top, right, bottom, or left of the
existing editor folder.&nbsp; The "no drop" icon should appear if you are
over a view.&nbsp; Drop the editor below the existing folder.</li>

<li>
Drag another editor our of the folder onto the single view.&nbsp; Verify
that the first folder is deconstructed and that a new folder is constructed.</li>

<li>
Maximize the active editor by clicking on the title area.&nbsp; Minimize
it by clicking in the area again.&nbsp; Maximize it again and then close
it.&nbsp; Verify that the perspective layout is restored.</li>

<li>
Drag a bunch of views out of the window to create detached windows.&nbsp;
Try dragging these views on top of one another to create detached folders.</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Reset.&nbsp; Answer yes to the dialog and verify that
the layout of the perspective is restored to the original.</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Close to close the page.</li>
</ol>
Perspective Save As:
<ol>
<li>
Open the resource perspective.</li>

<li>
Drag a view onto the left tool bar.&nbsp; Drag another out into a detached
window.</li>

<li>
In Eclipse you can customize the actions visible in a perspective.&nbsp;
Invoke Perspective > Customize and select some new views and actions.&nbsp;
Press OK and verify that the new actions appear in the menu and toolbar.</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Save As and select the Resource perspective.&nbsp;
Press OK and answer yes to the verify dialog.</li>

<li>
Close the perspective.</li>

<li>
Open the Resource perspective.&nbsp; Verify that the new page has the same
layout and visible action sets as you created and saved.</li>

<li>
Close the perspective.</li>

<li>
Open up the Preferences dialog and view the Perspectives page.&nbsp; Select
the Resource one and press Reset.</li>

<li>
Open the Resource perspective.&nbsp; Verify that the new page has the default
layout.</li>

<li>
Drag a view onto the left tool bar.&nbsp; Drag another out into a detached
window.</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Save As and type the name of a new perspective (ie
Bob).&nbsp; Press OK and then verify that the window title changes to reflect
the new perspective.</li>

<li>
Close all perspectives</li>

<li>
Open a new Resource perspective and a Bob perspective.&nbsp; Verify that
the first has the default layout and that the second has your custom layout.</li>
</ol>
Testing Two or More Perspectives:
<ol>
<li>
Close all Perspectives</li>

<li>
Open a Resource perspective.&nbsp; Verify that a new page appears in the
window with the Resource perspective.</li>

<li>
In the Navigator select your project and invoke Open Perspective > Java.&nbsp;
Verify that a new perspective appears with the Java Perspective and that
the input for the navigator is the project.&nbsp; Cool: Perspectives support
scoping !!</li>

<li>
In the Java perspective open one of the text files in an editor.</li>

<li>
Drag a couple of views out of the window to create detached windows.</li>

<li>
Modify the action sets.</li>

<li>
Switch back and forth between the two pages in the window by clicking in
the left hand tool bar.&nbsp; The active perspective controls the visible
action sets, views and editors in the window.&nbsp; If you switch between
two pages these attributes should change.</li>

<li>
Try Perspective > Next and Previous.</li>

<li>
Close the second perspective by invoking Perspective > Close.&nbsp; Verify
that the first perspective is activated.</li>
</ol>
Multiple Windows
<ol>
<li>
Start with one open window which has one perspective.</li>

<li>
Change the Workbench Preferences for "Open Perspective" to "Open in New
Window".&nbsp; Then open a Java perspective and verify that a new window
is created.</li>

<li>
A list of the open windows should appear in the Window menu.&nbsp; Select
these items to switch between the windows.</li>

<li>
Close one window and verify that the other is activated.</li>

<li>
Close the last window and verify that the workbench shuts down.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Persistence</h3>
Purpose: To test peristance in the workbench.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.&nbsp; Confirm that the default perspective (Resource)
and welcome editor both appear.</li>

<li>
Create a project with 3 files, one.txt, two.txt, and three.txt.&nbsp; Open
one.txt in the default perspective.</li>

<li>
In the navigator select the project and invoke Open Perspective > Java
from the context menu.&nbsp; Verify that a new Java perspective appears
in the current window.&nbsp; The input for the Packages view and navigator
should be the project.</li>

<li>
Open two.txt in the Java perspective.</li>

<li>
Change the Workbench Preferences for "Open Perspective" to "Open in New
Window".&nbsp; Then open a Java perspective and verify that a new window
is created.</li>

<li>
Now we have two windows.&nbsp; The first window has two perspectives (resource
and java).&nbsp; In the resource perspective one.txt is open in an editor.&nbsp;
In the java perspective two.txt is open in an editor.&nbsp; In the second
window here is one Java perspective with no open editors.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Exit.&nbsp; Then restart the workbench and verify that the
window, perspective and editor state of the workbench is restored.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Navigator View</h3>
Purpose: To test the Navigator view in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will start out
with an empty workspace, create some projects and files, open files, open
some new perspectives, delete some files, test the filtering and sorting
options, and test the persistance of view state between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.&nbsp; Confirm that the default perspective (Resource)
and welcome editor both appear.</li>

<li>
Create a project using the File > New wizard and verify that it appears
in the navigator.</li>

<li>
Create another project by invoking New > Project from the navigator popup
menu.&nbsp; Verify that it appears in the navigator.</li>

<li>
Create a .txt file, a .html file, and a .java file by invoking New > File
from the navigator popup menu.&nbsp; Verify that these files appear in
the navigator and that an editor is opened on each.&nbsp; Close all of
these editors.</li>

<li>
In the Navigator you can change the input.&nbsp; To test this create a
couple of nested folders in a project using the New > Folder action in
the navigator context menu.&nbsp; Then select the top level folder and
and invoke Go Into.&nbsp; Verify that the input for the view changes (it
is shown in the view title) and that only the resources in the input folder
are visible.&nbsp; If you perform the same operation many times you create
a history list in the navigator.&nbsp; Try navigating up and down the history
by using the Back and Forward buttons on the view toolbar.</li>

<li>
If you select a file you can open it from the context menu.&nbsp; Open
a .txt file and verify that the default text editor opens.&nbsp; Open a
.java file and verify that the java editor opens.</li>

<li>
You can also open a file in a specific editor.&nbsp; Select a .java file
and invoke Open With > Default Text Editor.&nbsp; The default text editor
should open rather than the java editor.&nbsp; If you select Open With
> System Editor something like notepad should open.&nbsp; The preferred
editor for a file is always indicated with a check mark in the Open With
menu.</li>

<li>
In the navigator you can open new perspectives.&nbsp; Select a project
or folder in the navigator and invoke Open Perspective > Java from the
context menu. Verify that a new perspective appears with the Java Perspective
and that the input for the navigator is the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close it and go back to the first perspective.</li>

<li>
The contents of the Open Perspective menu are determined by the perspective
properties.&nbsp; Note the contents of this menu.&nbsp; Then invoke Perspective
> Customize and change the checked perspectives.&nbsp; Press OK and verify
that the contents of Open Perspective reflect the new options.</li>

<li>
The Navigator has support for drag and drop.&nbsp; Try dragging a file
from one project to another.&nbsp; A cursor should appear to indicate the
drop target.&nbsp; If you release the file it will be moved to the target.</li>

<li>
In the navigator select a project, folder or file and try out Copy, Move
and Rename in the context menu.</li>

<li>
Select a project, folder or file and invoke Delete in the context menu
to delete it.&nbsp; Verify that the item disappears from the navigator.&nbsp;
The delete action is also available in the window Edit menu.&nbsp; Select
an item, invoke Edit > Delete, and verify that it has the same behavior.</li>

<li>
Select a file in the navigator and invoke Add Bookmark from the context
menu.&nbsp; Open up the Bookmark view and verify that a bookmark now exists.&nbsp;
If you double click on the bookmark an editor should open on the bookmark
source file.&nbsp; Verify that Add Bookmark is not available if a project
or folder is selected in the navigator.</li>

<li>
Select a project and invoke Close Project from the context menu.&nbsp;
At this point the icon should change to a closed folder and all of the
contents will be hidden.&nbsp; Invoke Open Project to reopen it and navigate
the contents.</li>

<li>
If you select a resource and invoke Properties.. a properties dialog should
appear.&nbsp; It will contain at least an Info, Project Referenes and Team
page for projects, and an Info and Team page for folders or files.</li>

<li>
In the navigator you can sort items by name or type.&nbsp; Try out these
options in the pulldown menu and verify that they have the correct affect.&nbsp;
All sorting is done in ascending order.&nbsp; You can also filter items
out.&nbsp; Create a couple of .class and .* files and experiment with the
filter options.&nbsp; You should be able to hide or show these files as
desired.</li>

<li>
The selection in the navigator is linked to the active editor.&nbsp; Open
a couple of files.&nbsp; Then switch between the editors and verify that
the editor input is selected in the navigator.&nbsp; Now select one of
the open files in the navigator and verify that the corresponding editor
is activated.&nbsp; You can disable this option by turning off "Link navigator
selection to active editor" in the workbench preferences.&nbsp; Then verify
that no selection occurs in the navigator as you switch between editors.&nbsp;
Turn it back on and verify that selection works again.</li>

<li>
The state of the navigator (input, expansion) should be stored between
sessions.&nbsp; To test this open a perspective with the navigator, change
the input and expansions state, and then close the workbench.&nbsp; Restart
the workbench and verify that the input and expansion state is restored.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Outline View</h3>
Purpose: To test the Outline view in Eclipse.&nbsp; The Outline view is
just a container for the pages contributed by open editors.&nbsp; Therefore,
this test will focus on the creation, show, and closure of those pages.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Create a java project containing three java files and a text file.</li>

<li>
Verify that the Outline view is empty and contains the text "An Outline
is not available".</li>

<li>
Open an editor on a java file. Verify that a java page appears in the outline
view.&nbsp; If you select items in this page the scroll and selected text
within the editor should change.</li>

<li>
Open a second file in a java editor.&nbsp; Verify that a second java page
appears in the outline view.</li>

<li>
If you switch between the two editors the visible page should change.</li>

<li>
Open a .txt file in a text editor.&nbsp; When this editor is active the
outline view will be empty and contain the standard empty text as described
in step 2.</li>

<li>
If you switch between a text and java editor the visible page should change.&nbsp;
Verify that the toolbar and menu items in the outline also chnage.&nbsp;
The java editor has Field and Member toolbar items.</li>

<li>
Close one editor.&nbsp; If another editor is activated verify that its
outline page is now visible.&nbsp; If no editor is activated verify that
the outline is empty.</li>

<li>
Close the last editor and verify that the default blank page is visible
in the outline.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Properties View</h3>
Purpose: To test the Properties view in Eclipse.&nbsp; The Outline view
is just a container for the pages contributed by other editors and views
within the workbench.&nbsp; Therefore, this test will focus on the creation,
show, and closure of those pages.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Create a project containing some files.</li>

<h3>
Tasks View</h3>
Purpose: To test the Tasks view in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will create a java
project with java classes, introduce errors in those classes, add tasks
to the files, and then verify them in the tasks list.&nbsp; We also test
the persistance of task filtering between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Create a Java Project named TaskProject.&nbsp; Then create a class named
TaskClass with the following content.</li>

<p><br><tt>public class TaskClass {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;private int y;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;public TaskClass() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;public void doThis() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;}</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;abstract public void doThat();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;public int getX() {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; return x;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;}</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If you save this file 2 errors will appear in the source.&nbsp; On line
7 there is an error because abstract methods can only be defined in an
abstract class.&nbsp; On line 9 there is an error because x is unknown.</li>

<li>
Open the Tasks view by invoking Perspective > Show View > Tasks.&nbsp;
Verify that the tasks views appears and that it shows the 2 errors in the
TaskClass.</li>

<li>
Select the first line of TaskClass and invoke "Add Task" from the context
menu.&nbsp; Override the label with "Test Label" and press OK.&nbsp; Verify
that a new task icon appears on the left edge of the editor and in the
tasks view.</li>

<li>
If a problem is resolved or a task removed it should disappear from the
task view.&nbsp; Open the Task view filter dialog and reset all options
with the Reset button.&nbsp; Press OK and go back to the editor for TaskClass.java.&nbsp;
Delete the "doThat" method and save the file.&nbsp; Verify that one of
the errors on TaskClass.java is deleted.</li>

<li>
Now select the Tasks view and select the task item labelled "Test Label".&nbsp;
Invoke Edit > Delete to delete this task and then verify that it disappears
from the tasks view and from the open editor.</li>

<li>
Within the Tasks view you can also create new tasks.&nbsp; To test this
press the "New Task" button on the toolbar.&nbsp; A new task should appear.&nbsp;
Type in the label for this task and press Return.&nbsp; Verify that a new
task is created.&nbsp; Do this a couple of times to create more than one
task.</li>

<li>
A task is very similar to a bookmark.&nbsp; If you select a task you can
open an editor on the task source.&nbsp; To test this close all editors.&nbsp;
Then select one of the java problems for TaskClass.java and invoke Go To
File in the context menu.&nbsp; Verify that an editor opens on the problem
and that the problem is indicated by selection in the editor.</li>

<li>
Now invoke the Filters toolbar action and change the "show entries of type"
option to "Java Problem" and nothing else.&nbsp; Press OK and verify that
only Java problems appear in the task list now.</li>

<li>
Reopen the Filters dialog and select "On Selected Resource Only".&nbsp;
Press OK.&nbsp; Now select TaskClass.java in the navigator and verify that
the java problems for this file are visible in the navigator.&nbsp; Select
the TaskProject and verify that the java problems for TaskClass.java are
not visible.</li>

<li>
Now the task list contains a number of errors and tasks.&nbsp; It also
has a couple of filtering options (java problems only and selected resource
only).&nbsp; This state is persisted between sessions.&nbsp; To test this
note the state of the task view.&nbsp; Then close the workbench and restart
it.&nbsp; Verify that the visible set of tasks and the filtering options
are restored.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Text Editor</h3>
Purpose: To test the Text Editor in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will open a text
file, adding some text, play with the edit actions, verify the save and
save as, and then test persistance between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Create a project.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > New > File.&nbsp; Create a new text file with some name like
test1.txt.&nbsp; Verify that a new editor opens on the file.</li>

<li>
Copy and paste the following text into the editor ..</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among
God's primates,
<br>he kills for sport, or lust or greed. Yes, he will murder his brother
to possess his
<br>brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make
a desert of
<br>his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him back into his jungle lair:
For he is the
<br>harbinger of death.
<p>(Planet of the Apes)</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>
After paste has been performed the editor state should be dirty.&nbsp;
Verify that File > Save is enabled and that Save is enabled in the context
menu.&nbsp; Invoke Save and verify that save is disabled.</li>

<li>
The Save As menu action is always enabled.&nbsp; Invoke this action to
create a new file, say test2.txt, and verify that the name of the new file
name is reflected in the editor tab.</li>

<li>
Modify the contents of test2.txt and save.&nbsp; Then open test1.txt and
verify that it still contains the original text.</li>

<li>
In text1.txt select the first 3 lines and invoke Edit Copy.&nbsp; Activate
text2.txt, put the cursor at the end of the file, and invoke Edit Paste.&nbsp;
Verify that the first 3 lines of text1.txt are copied to text2.txt.</li>

<li>
Invoke Undo and Redo a few times in text2.txt to undo and redo the paste.</li>

<li>
Select a few lines of text and invoke Shift Right and Shift Left a few
times.</li>

<li>
Now close text2.txt.&nbsp; The file has been modified, so a Save dialog
should appear.&nbsp; Press No to avoid saving.</li>

<li>
Now we need to test Find / Replace.&nbsp; Select the text1.txt editor.&nbsp;
This file contains many instances of he and his.&nbsp; Invoke Find / Replace
and replace all instances of he by "she".&nbsp; You may find that various
words like "the" are modified to "tshe".&nbsp; Close the find dialog and
invoke Revert in the context menu.&nbsp; Verify that the file contents
are now equal to the original text.&nbsp; Then try Find / Replace again
with "whole word" selected and verify the results.</li>

<li>
Open up text2.txt.&nbsp; Now there should be one open editor with changs
and one without.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Close All.&nbsp; At this point a "Save Resources" dialog
should appear where you can save the modified files.&nbsp; Check all modifications
and then press "Yes".&nbsp; Verify that all editors are closed.&nbsp; Then
open up any editor which was saved and verify changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Preferences</h3>
Purpose: To test the Preferences in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will open the Preferences
dialog, select some pages, change and apply preferences, verify their affect,
and test persistance between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Invoke Window > Preferences and verify that the Preference dialog appears.&nbsp;
Click on all of the items in the left hand viewer to demonstrate that each
item has a valid page and no exceptions occur in their creation.&nbsp;
Now close the dialog.</li>

<li>
The behavior of the workbench can be customized using the preferences.&nbsp;
To see this in action we will examine various preferences which ship with
Eclipse.</li>

<li>
The selection in the navigator is linked to the active editor.&nbsp; Open
a couple of files.&nbsp; Then switch between the editors and watch how
the input for the active editor is selected in the navigator.&nbsp; You
can disable this option in the Preferences.&nbsp; To do this ..</li>

<ol>
<li>
Open the preferences dialog.</li>

<li>
Turning off "Link navigator selection to active editor" in the workbench
preferences.</li>

<li>
Press OK.&nbsp; The dialog should close.</li>

<li>
Now switch between the editors.&nbsp; Notice that the selection in the
navigator does not change.</li>
</ol>

<li>
The Perspective > Open menu action can also be customized.&nbsp; By default
this action will open a new perspective in the current window.&nbsp; You
can change this to "open in new window" or "replace other".&nbsp; To see
this behavior ..</li>

<ol>
<li>
Open the preferences dialog.&nbsp; Change the workbench preferences for
"Open Perspective" to "Open in New Window".&nbsp; Then press OK</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Open > Java.&nbsp; Notice how a new window is created
for the perspective.&nbsp; The list of open windows is shown in the Window
menu.&nbsp; Select these items to switch between the windows.</li>
</ol>

<li>
If you don't like the current preferences you can reset them.&nbsp; Open
the preferences dialog again.&nbsp; To reset the state of "Link navigator
.." and "Open Perspective .." press the Restore Defaults button.&nbsp;
If you press OK the options will be saved.&nbsp; However, let's assume
that you decide not to change them.&nbsp; Press Cancel.&nbsp; Then verify
that the deviant options have not been restored to default by switching
between editors and opening a new perspective.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Exit.&nbsp; Then restart the workbench.</li>

<li>
Open the preferences dialog and confirm tha "Link navigator .. " and "Open
Perspective .." still reflect the customized values.&nbsp; The workbench
will automatically save your preferences between sessions.</li>
