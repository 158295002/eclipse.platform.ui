<h2>
The Workbench Test Suite</h2>
Dave Springgay
<br>September 2001
<h3>
In Brief</h3>
This document describes the UI Test Suite.&nbsp; The existing workbench
tests and the test framework are a work in progress.&nbsp; For more information
on the test framework see the documentation within the <tt>org.eclipse.ui.test.harness.launcher</tt>
plugin.&nbsp; For more information on JUnit see www.junit.org.
<h3>
Installation</h3>
To use this test suite you must install the following projects in your
Eclipse plugin directory.
<blockquote><tt>org.junit</tt>
<br><tt>org.eclipse.ui.test.harness</tt>
<br><tt>org.eclipse.ui.test.harness.launcher</tt>
<br><tt>org.eclipse.ui.tests</tt></blockquote>
Note: org.junit is available from the core repository.&nbsp; The other
projects are available from the desktop repository.
<p>The UI tests are available in&nbsp; <tt>org.eclipse.ui.tests</tt> and
consist of a series of non-interactive sniff tests which are run after
a build, plus a set of interactive tests which require human feedback.&nbsp;
You can run any of these from the Tests view or the command line.
<p>The <tt>org.eclipse.ui.tests</tt> project is organized in hierarchical
fashion.&nbsp; The root is <tt>UiTestSuite</tt> in <tt>org.eclipse.ui.tests</tt>.&nbsp;
This test suite contains a collection of "specialized suites" which test
specific areas of functionality or components in the workbench.&nbsp; Currently
there is only one suite, <tt>ApiTestSuite
</tt>in<tt> org.eclipse.ui.tests.api</tt>,
which contains a number of test cases which deal specifically with workbench
API.&nbsp; A <tt>uiTest</tt> extension is declared for each suite so that
you can run every test in the workbench or a subset of the tests.
<p>To run the workbench test suite from the command line set the execution
arguments for <tt>org.eclipse.ui.test.harness.launcher.TestUIMain</tt>
to ..
<blockquote><tt>-dev bin -data d:/temp/eclipse -uiTest ui.TestSuite</tt></blockquote>
Then run TestUIMain.
<h3>
Automated Sniff Tests</h3>
The following process is used to run the workbench UI sniff tests after
a build.
<p>To create the sniff test files ..
<ol>
<li>
Export the 4 test projects into a zip file.&nbsp; The options in the export
wizard should be set to "Compress the contents of the file" and not "Create
directory Structure".</li>
</ol>
To run the sniff tests in a fresh build of Eclipse ..
<ol>
<li>
Unzip the zip file in the Eclipse plugins directory.</li>

<li>
On Windows copy uiSniff.bat in the org.eclipse.ui.tests plugin directory
to the Eclipse home directory.&nbsp; On Linux copy uiSniff instead.</li>

<li>
Run uiSniff.bat ( or uiSniff ).&nbsp; Redirect the results into a file.</li>
</ol>
