This is a test list for Status Handling (StatusManager, StatusDialog, etc.):

MessageDialog (the status handling is not hooked into MessageDialog and ErrorDialog,
but we can still verify the cues below)
	Verify that SHMenu->'Open InfoDialog Action' displays a dialog with the Info icon
	Verify that SHMenu->'Open WarningDialog Action' displays a dialog with the Warning icon 
	Verify that SHMenu->'Open ErrorDialog Action' displays a dialog with the Error icon
	
Actions
	Verify that SHMenu->'Throw NullPointer Action' causes a NullPointerException to be logged
		into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log); an error dialog should not be displayed;
	Verify that SHMenu->'Throw OutOfMemory Action' causes a OutOfMemoryError to be logged
		into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log); an error dialog should not be displayed;

	Verify that 'Run In UI thread (does not fork)' button causes a stack trace to be sent to 
		the standard output

	Verify that 'Create jobs' button causes two exceptions/errors (from two jobs) to be displayed
		in a single dialog and logged into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log)

Views/Editors
	Verify that 'Show view throwing PartInitException' button causes a empty view to be displayed
		and a PartInitException to be logged into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log)

		and a RuntimeException to be logged into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log)

Invalid extensions
	Verify that 'Extensions - invalid references determined at load time' button causes a message
		similar to: 'Plugin org.eclipse.ui.tests, extension org.eclipse.ui.tests.sample
					 Unknown extension tag found: invalid' 
		to be logged into the WorkbenchPlugin log (.metadata/.log)
		
StatusManager
* Set Up:	For every show/log combination (none, log, show, show and log) add one status. 
				(Use 'Add status to the list' button and 'Show status (UI dialog)' & 
				'Log status' checkboxes)
	Verify that pressing the 'Handle statuses (StatusManager)' button causes:
	 	- all of the statuses with 'log' property on to be logged into the WorkbenchPlugin 
	 		log (.metadata/.log)
	 	- all of the statuses with 'show' property on to be displayed in a single dialog
