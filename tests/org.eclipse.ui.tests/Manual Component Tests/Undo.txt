This is a test list for the integrated undo/redo framework

Actions
	Verify that "Undo Typing" appears in action bar edit menu and editor popup menu once text has been typed.
	Verify that "Redo Typing" appears in action bar edit menu immediately after an undo has been performed.
	Verify that "Undo <name of refactoring op>" appears in action bar edit menu and editor popup menu immediately after performing a refactoring from that editor.
	Verify that "Undo <name of refactoring op>" appears in action bar edit menu of Package Explorer and Navigator after performing a refactoring from anywhere.

Preferences
	Set different text undo limits (including 0) in the text editor preferences (General>Editors>TextEditors>Undo history size) and verify they work as expected.
Integrated Scenarios
  <setup>
	For the following text-refactoring integrated scenarios, do the following first:
	a.  Create a Java project "Undo Scenarios".
	b.  Create a package "xxx".
	c.  Copy the java files provided in org.eclipse.ui.tests/ManualComponentTests/Undo test files to "xxx".
  <simple refactoring undo>
  	a.  Open A.Java and B.java
  	b.  In A, click in the method name for "bar" and choose Refactor>Rename
  	c.  Rename "bar" to "bar2"
  	d.  Verify that "Undo Rename method bar to bar2" appears in Edit>Undo in pulldown menu of editor, editor popup, Package Explorer, and Navigator.
  	e.  Select "Undo Rename method bar to bar2" from any of these locations
  	f.  Operation is undone without prompting or warning
  	g.  Verify that "Redo Rename method bar to bar2" appears in Edit>Undo pulldown menu for the editor, Navigator, and Package Explorer.
  	h.  Select "Redo Rename method bar to bar2" from any of these locations
  	i.  Operation is redone without prompting or warning
  	j.  Undo again to revert files to original state and close editors.
  <prompt on non-local undo>
    a.  Open A.Java and B.java
  	b.  In A, click in the method name for "foo" and choose Refactor>Rename
  	c.  Rename "foo" to "foo2"
  	d.  Verify that "Undo Rename method bar to bar2" appears in Edit>Undo in pulldown menu of editor, editor popup, Package Explorer, and Navigator.
  	e.  Select "Undo Rename method bar to bar2" from A's edit menu.
  	f.  Operation prompts as to whether you want to proceed since the refactoring affects other files.
  	g.  Select "yes" and operation is undone.
  	h.  Select "Redo Rename method bar to bar2" from package explorer.
  	i.  Operation is redone without prompting or warning.
  	j.  Undo again to revert files to original state and close editors.
  <detection of changed file>
    a.  Open A.Java and B.java
  	b.  In A, click in the method name for "foo" and choose Refactor>Rename
  	c.  Rename "foo" to "foo2"
  	d.  In B, type some text anywhere.
  	e.  Go back to A and Select "Undo Rename method bar to bar2" from A's edit menu.
  	f.  Operation informs you that it cannot be completed since B has changed.
  	g.  Select OK
  	h.  Choose "Undo Typing" from A to revert the text part of the refactoring
  	i.  Go to B and choose "Undo Typing" to revert the typed changes followed by the text part of the refactoring change.
