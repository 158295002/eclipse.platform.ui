 * Clients may supply the viewer in {@link #createContentService(String, StructuredViewer) }
 * or wait until the content provider is created by the service 
 * and set on the viewer. When the content provider is set, the 
 * viewer will call inputChanged(), and the content service
 * will update its managed viewer accordingly. Therefore, each
 * content service should be attached to at most one viewer.
