	</head>

	<body>
		<abstract>Provides the foundation of the Common Navigator. The Common Navigator 
				is a framework for multiple providers to intermingle heterogeneous content.
		</abstract>
		<p>The Common Navigator allows various types of content to be
			added to the same viewer in an extensible and transparent
			manner.
		</p>
		<img src="../../../../../overview/framework-overview.jpg" caption="The Core API available to consumers." />
		<p>
			Clients that wish to add content to an existing Common
			Navigator require the components described by Figure 2. The
			<b>Logical Enablement Clause</b>
			describes when the extension should be invoked using a
			generic Action Expression.
		</p>
		<img src="../../../../../overview/navigator_logical_extension.jpg" 
			 caption="A logical content extension for the Common Navigator." />

		<p>
			When the Common Navigator finds an object for which the
			extension is interested in supplying children, the extension
			is loaded and the
			<code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ITreeContentProvider</code>
			is requested to supply children for the object. Then, the
			<code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ILabelProvider</code>
			is invoked to supply image and text to display when rendering
			the object in the viewer. Some clients may choose to
			implement
			<code>
				org.eclipse.wst.common.navigator.views.ICommonLabelProvider
			</code>
			for the extra information that will be supplied to
			implementors of that interface. However, clients are only
			required to implement
			<code>ILabelProvider</code>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			The
			<code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.IOpenListener</code>
			will be invoked to handle user request to open objects that
			the extension is interested in (as specified in the
			<b>Logical Enablement Expression</b>
			). Like
			<code>ICommonLabelProvider</code>
			, clients may choose to implement
			<code>
				org.eclipse.wst.common.navigator.views.ICommonOpenListener
			</code>
			for tighter integration with the Common Navigator.
		</p>
		<p>
			The
			<code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ICommonActionProvider</code>
			will have opportunities at appropriate times to contribute to
			the popup context menu and the IActionBars (used for
			retargetable actions).
