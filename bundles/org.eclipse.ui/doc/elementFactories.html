<b><i>Identifier: </i></b>org.eclipse.ui.elementFactories<p>
<b><i>Description: </i></b>This extension point is used to add element factories 
to the workbench.  An element factory is used to 
recreate <samp>IAdaptable</samp> objects which are 
persisted during workbench shutdown. 
<p>
As an example, the element factory is used to 
persist editor input.  The input for an 
editor must implement 
<samp>org.eclipse.ui.EditorInput</samp>.  
The life cycle of an <samp>IEditorInput</samp> within 
an editor has a number of phases. 
<ol>
<li>
The initial input for an editor is passed in during 
editor creation. 
</li>
<li>
On shutdown the workbench state is captured.  
In this process the workbench will create a memento 
for each open editor and its input.  The input is 
saved as a two part memento containing a factory ID 
and any primitive data required to recreate the 
element on startup.  For more information see 
the documentation on 
<samp>org.eclipse.ui.IPersistableElement</samp>. 
</li>
<li>
On startup the workbench state is read and the 
editors from the previous session are recreated.  
In this process the workbench will recreate the input 
element for each open editor.  To do this it will 
map the original factory ID for the input element 
to a concrete factory class defined in the registry.  
If a mapping exists, and the factory class is valid, 
an instance of the factory class is created.  Then 
the workbench asks the factory to recreate the original 
element from the remaining primitive data within the 
memento.  The resulting <samp>IAdaptable</samp> is cast
to an <samp>IEditorInput</samp> and passed to the 
new editor. 
</li>

<ul>
<li><b>point</b> - a fully qualified identifier of the target extension point</li><li><b>id</b> - an optional identifier of the extension instance</li><li><b>name</b> - an optional name of the extension instance</li></ul>

<br><samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&nbsp;CDATA #REQUIRED</samp>
<br><samp>&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;</samp>
<ul>
<li><b>id</b> - a unique name that will be used to identify this factory.</li><li><b>class</b> - a fully qualified name of a class that implements 
<samp>org.eclipse.ui.IElementFactory</samp></li></ul>
<b><i>Examples: </i></b>The following is an example of an element factory extension: 
<p>
<pre>
   &lt;extension 
        point = "org.eclipse.ui.elementFactories"&gt; 
        &lt;factory 
           id ="com.xyz.ElementFactory" 
           class="com.xyz.ElementFactory"&gt; 
        &lt;/factory&gt; 
    &lt;/extension&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
<b><i>API Information: </i></b>The value of the <samp>class</samp> attribute must 
be a fully qualified name of a class that implements 
<samp>org.eclipse.ui.IElementFactory</samp>. An instance 
of this class must create an <samp>IAdaptable</samp> 
object from a workbench memento.<p>
<b><i>Supplied Implementation: </i></b>The workbench provides an <samp>IResource</samp> factory.  
Additional factories should be added to recreate other 
<samp>IAdaptable</samp> types commonly found in other 
object models, such as the Java Model.<p>
