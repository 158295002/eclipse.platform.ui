/**
 * A editor action bar contributor defines the actions for
 * one or more editors.  
 * <p>
 * Within the workbench there may be more than one open editor of a particular
 * type.  For instance, there may be 1 or more open Java Editors.  To avoid the 
 * creation of duplicate actions and action images the editor concept has been 
 * split into two.  An action contributor is responsable for the creation of 
 * actions.  The editor is responsable for action implementation.  Furthermore,
 * the contributor is shared by each open editor.  As a result of this design
 * there is only 1 set of actions for 1 or more open editors.
 * </p><p>
 * The relationship between editor and contributor is defined by
 * the <code>org.eclipse.ui.editorss</code> extension point in the plugin registry.  
 * For each extension an editor class and a contributor class must be defined. 
 * </p><p>
 * For convenience, an implementation of this interface has been 
 * created in <code>EditorActionBarContributor</code>.  Implementors
 * should subclass this and specialize as required.
 * </p>
