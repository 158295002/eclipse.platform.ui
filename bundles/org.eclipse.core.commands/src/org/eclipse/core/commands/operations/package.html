Classes for the creation of undoable operations which can be added to an operations
history to be undone and redone.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
An <b>undoable operation</b> is unit of work that can be executed, undone, and redone.
It can be added to an <b>operation history</b> so that clients can provide undo and
redo of operations in the history.  Operations may be assigned one or more
<b>undo contexts</b> which can be used to filter the available operations
in a history.  Clients may choose to provide undo and redo support for all operations
in a history or only a certain context in that history.  In this way, support for
global undo or a localized/filtered undo can be provided.  Operation histories may
be configured with an <b>operation approver</b> so that applications can enforce
any desired undo model, such as strict linear (LIFO) undo.  This package provides
the definition and a basic implementation for operations, contexts, histories, and
approvers.
