<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Try this experiment: Show Eclipse to some friends or co-workers who haven't
seen it before and ask them to guess what language it is written in. Chances
are, they'll guess VB, C++, or C#, because those languages are used most often
for high quality client side applications. Then watch the look on their faces
when you tell them it was created in Java, especially if they are Java
programmers.</p>
<p>Because of its unique open source license, you can use the technologies that
went into Eclipse to create your own commercial quality programs With previous
version of Eclipse, this was possible but difficult, especially when you wanted
to heavily customize the menus, layouts, and other user interface elements. That
was because the &quot;IDE-ness&quot; of Eclipse was hard-wired into it. Version
3 introduces the Rich Client Platform, which is basically a refactoring of the
fundamental parts of Eclipse's UI, allowing it to be used for non-IDE
applications.</p>
<p>If you want to cut to the chase and look at the code for this part
you can use Eclipse's built-in 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/cvshowto.html">CVS client</a>
to download the 
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1">source code</a>
to your workspace.
Otherwise, let's take a look at how to construct
an RCP application.</p>

<h2><a name="section_1"></a> Getting started</h2>
<p>RCP applications are based on the familiar Eclipse plug-in architecture, (if
it's not familiar to you, see the references section). Therefore, you'll need to
create a plug-in to be your main program.
Select New &gt; Project &gt; Plug-in
Development &gt; Plug-in Project to bring up the Plug-in Project wizard. On the
subsequent pages, enter a Project name such as <b>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</b>,
indicate you want a Java project, and
enter a Plug-in Id (this should match the project name).
</p>
<p>
The generated plug-in class that you may be familiar with in previous
releases is no longer required in Eclipse 3.0.
You can still have one to hold global data if you like, but for this
example just remove it altogether to save a little space.
To do this, turn off the option that says
Generate the Java class that controls the plug-ins life cycle.
Then Click on Finish to
generate the template.
If you get a dialog asking if Eclipse can switch to the Plug-in Development
Perspective click Yes (this is optional).</p>

<h2>Plug-in manifest</h2>
<p>The plug-in manifest, plugin.xml, ties all the code and resources together.
When you first create a plug-in, Eclipse will edit the manifest for you
automatically.
You need to define the class name of the main program
with the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension
and the perspective with <code>org.eclipse.ui.perspectives</code>.
To add these extensions use the Add button on the Extensions tab,
or just type in the XML in the plugin.xml tab.
Also, you need to tell Eclipse that the plug-in will depend on two other Eclipse plugins,
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility</code> and
<code>org.eclipse.ui</code>, so those need to be added to the
Dependencies tab or in the XML.
When you're done your plugin.xml should look something like listing 1.
The classes refered to here will be defined in the next section.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 1. plugin.xml
</b></p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;plugin
    id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1&quot;
    name=&quot;%pluginName&quot;
    version=&quot;0.0.0&quot;
    provider-name=&quot;%providerName&quot;&gt;

    &lt;runtime&gt;
        &lt;library name=&quot;part1.jar&quot;&gt;
            &lt;export name=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/library&gt;
    &lt;/runtime&gt;
    &lt;requires&gt;
        &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.ui&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/requires&gt;


    &lt;extension
        id=&quot;RcpApplication&quot;
        point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications&quot;&gt;
        &lt;application&gt;
            &lt;run
                class=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/run&gt;
        &lt;/application&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension
        point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.perspectives&quot;&gt;
        &lt;perspective
            name=&quot;%perspectiveName&quot;
            class=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective&quot;
            id=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/perspective&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<img src="images/note.gif" alt="Note: " width="62" height="13">
Although it's not an absolute requirement,
I recommend keeping your id's and your class names the same.
For example, <code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>
is both the fully qualified id for the application and the class name of the
main program.
For historical reasons, Eclipse prepends the plug-in's id to your
top level plug-in elements (like <code>extension</code>) so even though
plugin.xml says <code>id="RcpApplication"</code> the fully qualified id
for that extension is <code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>.
Ditto for the perspective,
<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective</code>.
</p>

<h2>The main program</h2>
<p>
The <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension tells
the Eclipse runtime the name of your main program.
Create a new Java class with that name,
make it implement <code>IPlatformRunnable</code>,
and put your program code in the <code>run()</code> method.
Listing 2 shows a simple implementation with the minimum you have to do.
The <code>RcpWorkbenchAdvisor</code> class will be defined shortly.
</p>
<p><b>Listing 2. RcpApplication class
</b></p>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;

import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPlatformRunnable;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display;
import org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI;
import org.eclipse.ui.application.WorkbenchAdvisor;

public class RcpApplication implements IPlatformRunnable {

    public Object run(Object args) {
        WorkbenchAdvisor workbenchAdvisor = new RcpWorkbenchAdvisor();
        Display display = PlatformUI.createDisplay();
        try {
            int returnCode = PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(display,
                    workbenchAdvisor);
            if (returnCode == PlatformUI.RETURN_RESTART) {
                return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_RESTART;
            } else {
                return IPlatformRunnable.EXIT_OK;
            }
        } finally {
            display.dispose();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Creating a default perspective</h2>
<p>
Next, you must define at least one perspective and make it the default.
Perspectives are created by implementing <code>IPerspectiveFactory</code>
using the class name referred to by the <code>org.eclipse.ui.perspectives</code> extension
(see listing 3).
The important part
of this interface is the <code>createInitialLayout()</code> method where you position and
open any views and/or editors you'd like the user to start with.
In this example
we're not going to create any views so it will be a pretty boring perspective.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 3. RcpPerspective class
</b></p>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;

import org.eclipse.ui.IPageLayout;
import org.eclipse.ui.IPerspectiveFactory;

public class RcpPerspective implements IPerspectiveFactory {

    public RcpPerspective() {
    }

    public void createInitialLayout(IPageLayout layout) {
    }
}

</pre>

<h2>Workbench Advisor</h2>
<p>
The Workbench Advisor class,
which you referred to in the main program,
helps customize the workbench to add and subtract
toolbars, perspectives, and so forth.
This will covered in more detail in part 2 of the tutorial.
For now, the absolute minimum you have to do here
is define which perspective is the default one.
See listing 4 for the code.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 4. RcpWorkbenchAdvisor class
</b></p>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1;
import org.eclipse.ui.application.WorkbenchAdvisor;

public class RcpWorkbenchAdvisor extends WorkbenchAdvisor {

    public String getInitialWindowPerspectiveId() {
        return &quot;org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpPerspective&quot;;
    }
}
</pre>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The build.properties file (see listing 5)
will be needed when exporting the application for
others to use.</p>

<p><b>Listing 5. build.properties
</b></p>
<pre>
bin.includes = plugin.xml,\
               *.jar,\
               part1.jar,\
               plugin.properties
source.part1.jar = src/
</pre>

<p>
Finally, you need to create a plugin.properties file (listing 6) for any natural language strings at the
plug-in registry level (i.e., things the run-time has to know about your plug-in
before even loading it).
You could hard-code these into your plug-in manifest
but it's best to get into the i18n habit from the start.
</p>

<p><b>Listing 6. plugin.properties
</b></p>
<pre>
pluginName = RcpTutorial1 Plug-in
providerName = Eclipse.org
perspectiveName = RcpTutorial1
</pre>

<h2>Taking it for a spin</h2>
<p>To test and debug this plug-in, select Run &gt;
Debug &gt; Debug..., select Run-time Workbench,
then click New to create a new configuration.
In the Arguments tab, select
<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</code>
for the Application name.
This comes from the id specified on the
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension point
(in this example, <code>RcpApplication</code>), prepended with the
plug-in id (<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</code>).
</p>
<p>Now switch over to the Plug-ins tab.
Select the option to
Choose plug-ins and fragments to launch from the list.
We want the smallest possible set of plug-ins involved
in your program so click on Deselect All,
scroll down and place a checkmark next to your plug-in
(<code>org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1</code>),
and click Add Required Plug-ins.
Then click on Debug and
you should see a bare-bones Workbench start up (see figure 1).</p>

<p><b>Figure 1. World's simplest RCP application.
</b></p>
<img src="images/spin.png">

<p>If you don't see this, you should be able to find an error message in the
run-time workbench's log file.
This file is in different places for different releases but
as of this writing can be found in <code>./configuration/nnnnn.log</code>
where <i>nnnnn</i> is a long random number. Simply bring
it up in a text editor and look for the most recent errors. You may find it
useful to delete the log files before running the program so you won't get
confused by older messages.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tip.gif" alt="Tip: " width="62" height="13">
Specify the <code>-consoleLog</code> option
in the Arguments tab under Program Arguments (in the launch configuration)
to have all error messages sent to the Console.
This is easier than searching around for the log file.
</p>

<h2>Running it outside of Eclipse</h2>
<p>The whole point of all this is to be able to run stand-alone applications
without the user having to know anything about the Java and Eclipse code being
used under the covers. For a real application you will probably want to provide
a self-contained executable generated by an install program like InstallShield.
That's really beyond the scope of this article though, so we'll do something
simpler.</p>
<p>We need to create a simplified version of the Eclipse install directory
because the Eclipse plug-in loader expects things to be in a certain layout.
Here are the steps to get started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right click on the plug-in project and select Export.
  <li>Select Deployable plug-ins and fragments and then press Next.
  <li>Select the plug-in(s) that should be included. For this
  example that would be org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.
  <li>Select the option to deploy as a directory structure, and for the
  directory enter a name ending with RcpTutorial1 (for example, C:\RcpTutorial1 on
  Windows).
  <li>If you want to provide source code for your application,
  select the Include source code option.
  <li>Press Finish to export the plug-in.
  Eclipse will perform a full build in the background
  and populate the directory for you.
</ol>
<p>To complete the RcpTutorial1 directory, copy the startup.jar file from the Eclipse
install directory into the top level, and copy all the org.eclipse plug-ins
that are required into the plugins directory.
Unfortunately, as of this writing there is no automatic way to do this
so you need to do the copies by hand.
</p>
<p>
Which plug-ins are required, you ask?
Earlier, when you created a launch configuration to debug
the RCP application you clicked on
the Add Required Plug-ins button.
Simply open the launch configuration again to see the list.
Copy all the plug-ins that are checked off there.
</p>
<p>
When you're
done you should have a structure that looks like this:</p>
<pre>
    RcpTutorial1
    |    startup.jar
    +--- plugins
         +--- org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.help_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.jface_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.osgi.services_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.osgi.util_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.osgi_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.swt.win32_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.swt_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.update.configurator_3.0.0
         +--- org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1
</pre>
<p>That's all you need to run an RCP application, but it would be difficult for
anyone to use it without some kind of launching program. Eclipse uses
eclipse.exe, but for this example we'll just use a batch file.
Create a Windows command file
called rcptutorial1.cmd and place it in the top level RcpTutorial1 directory. A Unix shell
script version would be similar.
<pre>
   echo on
   setlocal
   cd %~dp0
   start javaw -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
      -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication %*
   endlocal
</pre>
<p>The start command should be all on one line. As before, the -application
option refers back to the id specified on the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications extension point.</p>
<p>You can get as fancy as you want in this script file. Here's a variant that I
like to use when debugging because it will display any error messages from the
Eclipse loader in a separate window:</p>
<pre>
   echo on
   setlocal
   cd %~dp0
   java -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
      -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication
      -consoleLog %* || pause
   endlocal
</pre>
<p>The java command should be all on one line.</p>
<p>To eliminate the startup window on Windows, you can use a shortcut instead of
a script file. Right click inside the RcpTutorial1 folder, select New &gt; Shortcut
and enter this as the location of the item (on one line):</p>
<pre>
    %windir%\system32\javaw.exe -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
        -application org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication
</pre>
<p>Enter a descriptive name on the next page and then press Finish. Then try
double-clicking on your new shortcut to try it out. You may want to edit the
shortcut (right click on it and select Properties) to change the default working
directory.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tip.gif" alt="Tip: " width="62" height="13">
For fully branding a program with a splash screen, custom icons, and so forth
you'll need to set up some configuration files and use
the eclipse.exe launcher.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
After I wrote this tutorial I started getting mail from people who couldn't
run it for one reason or another.
This section will collect the errors that they've seen and
the solutions.
Remember to use the <code>-consoleLog</code> command line option to see
extra diagnostics in the console window where you invoked your
RCP application.
</p>
<dl>

<dt>
<b>Launching failed because the following plug-ins are neither in the
workspace nor selected on the Target Platform preference page: ...</b>
<dd>
This one is a sanity check performed by PDE.
It's pretty self explanitory so just look at the list
provided, go to the Plug-ins tab of your launch configuration,
and put a checkmark next to all of the plug-ins listed
in the error.

<dt>
<b>!MESSAGE Unable to locate application extension: org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part1.RcpApplication</b>
<dd>
First, check to make sure that the plug-in containing your
application is included in your launch configuration.
Next, check the spelling, and remember that the application name
is the plug-in id followed by a period and the id you specified on the
<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications</code> extension.
This message might also be printed if all the required
plug-ins are not available at run-time.

<dt>
<b>!MESSAGE Bundle reference:file:C:/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui_3.0.0 [13] was not resolved</b>
<dd>
This one is a little tougher.
It usually means that some prerequisite of the plug-in listed was not there
You can find out exactly what's going on by re-running the program
with the <code>-console</code> command line option.
This will allow you to enter OSGi console commands to diagnose the problem.
After the error occurs again, go to the console window and enter the
<code>ss</code> command.
You'll see one or more bundles which were installed but not resolved.
Pick one of them (in the above message it would be number 13), and enter the
<code>diag <i>nnn</i></code> command, where <i>nnn</i>
is the bundle number. For example, "<b>diag 13</b>".
This will tell you what the missing bundle is.
Note that you can't run OSGi commands if the program has already terminated.

<dt>
<b>!MESSAGE Missing required bundle org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility_null,null.</b>
<dd>
This can be caused if you have incompletely adopted your plug-in
to the 3.0 OSGi manifest files.
See the section on the compatibility layer for more information.


<dt>
<b>'1.4' target mode requires '-1.4' compliance mode: 1.3</b>
<dd>
This is one of the more annoying PDE build errors, especially since you have to go hunt
in a zip file for it.
To correct it, go to Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler
&gt; Compliance and Classfiles.
Adjust the compliance levels as follows:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Compiler compliance level: <td>1.4
<tr><td>Use default compliance settings: <td>off
<tr><td>Generated .class files compatibility: <td>1.4
<tr><td>Source compatibility: <td>1.4
<tr><td>Disallow identifiers called 'assert': <td>Error
</table>


</dl>


<h2>The compatibility layer</h2>
<p>
Astute readers will notice that this example uses the compatibility layer
(<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility</code>)
and may wonder exactly what that means.
Eclipse 3.0 introduced a new OSGi based run-time system,
a new plug-in manifest file named MANIFEST.MF,
and many API changes that broke compatibility with 2.1 plug-ins.
The compatibility layer preserves the API and converts plugin.xml on the fly
so it's possible to have a plug-in that works without modification in both
2.1 and 3.0.
</p>
<p>
As of this writing, most people are not familiar with the new system and the
PDE support is not fully tested (for example you have to take an
extra step to create MANIFEST.MF and there were some bugs late in the 3.0 cycle
editing it).
Also most plug-in documentation and articles were written before
the new run-time was in place.
The compatibility layer is completely adequate for this simple example, but
after you are comfortable with writing plug-ins and
RCP applications, you can look in the Eclipse 3.0 Runtime Adoption Guide
(in the references section)
to learn more about the new run-time
and how to run without the compatibility layer.
